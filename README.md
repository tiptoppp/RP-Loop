RP Loop is a small tool programmed in C# that allows you to earn RP in a loop. The operation is quite simple, when it is activated, the RP multiplier will be set to a value of 500 and every second, you will have one then zero stars which will earn you RP.
## COMMON PROBLEMS
The different problems I encountered during the test phase are :

 1. The number of stars alternates well between one and zero but no RP is earned. Solution : Switch lobby and start over.
 2. After activating then deactivating RP Loop, if you earn stars you will automatically lose them one second later. This is due to the loop which resets the number of stars to zero. Solution : Close RP Loop.
